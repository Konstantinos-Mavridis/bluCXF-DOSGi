Apache CXF Distributed OSGi 1.2 Release Notes
=============================================

In addition to providing the Reference Implementation to the OSGi Remote
Services Specification, the CXF Distributed OSGi 1.2 release now also
provides the Reference Implementation of the OSGi Remote Service Admin
Specification version 1.0, Chapter 122 in the OSGi Enterprise
Specification.

To achieve compliance with the RSA specification a major refactoring has
been done on the code base.

For the new features applicable to the RSA specification, see chapter
122 in the OSGi Enterprise Spec (http://www.osgi.org/Download/Release4V42).

The following new features have been introduced:

* org.apache.cxf.ws.port=[port number]
  This configuration property can be used to change the default port at which a remote
service appears. When setting this property the default context will
still be used.

* Servlet Filters (javax.servlet.Filter) can now be registered as OSGi services with
  an "org.apache.cxf.httpservice.filter" boolean property set to true and used to secure DOSGi server endpoints.
  Endpoints can enforce the registration of the filters by setting an "org.apache.cxf.httpservice.requirefilter" 
  boolean property to true

Additionally, a number of bugs has also been fixed.

Specific issues, features, and improvements fixed in this version
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Distributed OSGi 1.1 release provides the Reference Implementation
of the Remote Services Specification version 1.0. Chapter 13 in the OSGi
Compendium Specification (http://www.osgi.org/Download/Release4V42).

New features in this release include:

* A live Discovery System is now supported. The CXF-DOSGi implementation
  makes use of Apache Zookeeper (http://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper) as
  the Discovery Server and provides client-side bundles for transparent
  interaction with Zookeeper. See the Discovery Documentation pages
  (http://cxf.apache.org/dosgi-discovery.html) for more details.

* REST support for JAX-RS-based Remoted Services and Consumers through
  the org.apache.cxf.rs configuration type.

* Many user issues have been addressed. In addition the following bugs
  have been fixed:

[CXF-2182] - Exceptions when remoting pre-existing service
[CXF-2337] - org.apache.cxf.dosgi.dsw.ClassUtils#getInterfaceClass() method
             should search through super class interfaces too
[CXF-2435] - Distributed OSGi having a problem with a custom type method
             argument
[CXF-2288] - Bundle cannot be restarted
[CXF-2385] - Discovery doesn't fully translate 'localhost' into a proper 
             machine name
[CXF-2200] - Consuming more than 1 service using Spring-DM doesn't work


Known limitations :

* Schema validation can not be done for JAX-RS-based endpoints which use
  Aegis databinding
